sland Perimeter

Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

- grid is a list of list of integers:
    - 0 represents water
    - 1 represents land
    - Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
    - Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
    - grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
- The grid is completely surrounded by water
- There is only one island (or nothing).
